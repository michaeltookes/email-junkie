# CI release automation

Push a version tag and GitHub Actions cuts the whole release: it runs the
release gate (SwiftLint strict + full test suite), signs and notarizes the app,
builds and notarizes the DMG, runs the launch smoke test, publishes a GitHub
release with the CHANGELOG section as notes, updates the Sparkle appcast, and
bumps the Homebrew tap cask.

The workflow is `.github/workflows/release.yml`. It does **not** fork a second
pipeline — it runs the same `Distribution/scripts/release.sh` the maintainer
runs locally (see [`releasing.md`](./releasing.md)), only supplying credentials
from encrypted repository secrets instead of the login Keychain.

> Backlog item 29 stays open until the first real tagged release runs green
> through this workflow and Sparkle auto-update is verified end to end against
> the published appcast. This branch builds the workflow; it has never run
> against real secrets or a real tag.

## How it triggers

| Trigger | What runs |
| --- | --- |
| Push a tag matching `v*` (must be `vX.Y.Z`, e.g. `v0.1.2`) | Full signed release **and** publish (GitHub release + tap bump). |
| `workflow_dispatch` with **dry_run = true** (default) | Whole plumbing **unsigned** — archive, DMG layout, and launch smoke test — with no signing, notarization, or publishing. Testable with no secrets and no tag. |
| `workflow_dispatch` with **dry_run = false** | Signs and notarizes, but because there is no tag it does **not** publish or bump the tap (a real release must come from a tag). |

The version comes from the tag (`v0.1.2` → `0.1.2`); for a dispatch run it is read
from `MARKETING_VERSION` in the project file. Both paths must resolve to
`X.Y.Z`, and malformed tags such as `v0.2` fail before the release pipeline
publishes anything.

Release workflow runs share one concurrency group, so different tag releases do
not overlap while publishing and updating the tap.

For tagged releases, CI also compares `CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION` against the
previous stable release's Sparkle appcast build number and fails before the
release gate if the new build is not greater.

## Required repository secrets

Set these under **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions** on
`github.com/michaeltookes/sentwise`. Values never live in the repo. Each row
lists the exact local command that produces the value.

### `MACOS_CERTIFICATE_P12`
Base64 of a **Developer ID Application** certificate **plus its private key**,
exported as a `.p12`.

1. In **Keychain Access**, find `Developer ID Application: Your Name (TEAMID)`,
   expand it to include its private key, right-click → **Export 2 items…**,
   save as `DeveloperID.p12`, and set an export password (that password is the
   next secret).
2. Base64 it and copy to the clipboard:
   ```bash
   base64 -i DeveloperID.p12 | pbcopy
   ```
3. Paste as the secret value, then delete the file: `rm -P DeveloperID.p12`.

### `MACOS_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD`
The export password you set on the `.p12` in the step above. No command — it is
the string you typed.

### `APPLE_ID`
The Apple ID email of the Developer account used for notarization (the account
at [appleid.apple.com](https://appleid.apple.com)). No command.

### `APPLE_TEAM_ID`
Your 10-character Apple Developer Team ID. Read it off the signing identity:
```bash
security find-identity -v -p codesigning | grep "Developer ID Application"
# -> "... "Developer ID Application: Your Name (TEAMID)" ..." — TEAMID is the value
```
Used both as the signing team and as notarytool's `--team-id`.

### `NOTARY_APP_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD`
An app-specific password for notarytool (**not** your Apple ID password).
Generate one at [appleid.apple.com](https://appleid.apple.com) →
**Sign-In and Security → App-Specific Passwords → +**. Copy the generated
`abcd-efgh-ijkl-mnop` string. On CI, notarytool is called with
`--apple-id / --team-id / --password` (no Keychain profile).

### `SPARKLE_ED_PRIVATE_KEY`
The EdDSA **private** key whose public half is already committed in
`Sentwise/Info.plist` as `SUPublicEDKey` (established for v0.1.0). Export the
existing key from your login Keychain with Sparkle's `generate_keys` and copy
the file's full contents:
```bash
# From Sparkle's tools (the same 2.9.5 bin/ the workflow downloads):
./bin/generate_keys -x sparkle_private_key.txt   # exports the EXISTING key
pbcopy < sparkle_private_key.txt                  # copy full file contents -> secret
rm -P sparkle_private_key.txt                     # securely delete
```
On CI the secret is written back to a temp file and passed to
`generate_appcast --ed-key-file` (there is no login Keychain on the runner).
**Do not** run `generate_keys` without `-x`: that would create a *new* keypair
and break auto-update for every installed client. See prerequisite 3 in
[`releasing.md`](./releasing.md).

### `TAP_PUSH_TOKEN`
A GitHub token with push access to `michaeltookes/homebrew-tap`, used to commit
the cask bump. Create a **fine-grained personal access token**
([github.com/settings/tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens)) scoped to the
`homebrew-tap` repository with **Contents: Read and write**, and paste it.

---

## Sparkle tools on CI

The workflow downloads the **pinned** Sparkle `2.9.5` release tarball
(`Sparkle-2.9.5.tar.xz`) and points `SPARKLE_BIN` at its `bin/` directory. Keep
that pin in lockstep with the Sparkle SPM dependency version in
`Sentwise.xcodeproj` (currently `2.9.5`) — bump both together.

---

## How CI maps to `release.sh`

`release.sh` reads all credentials from the environment, so the workflow just
sets them:

| `release.sh` env var | CI source |
| --- | --- |
| `SIGNING_IDENTITY` | derived from the imported cert via `security find-identity` |
| `DEVELOPMENT_TEAM` | `APPLE_TEAM_ID` secret |
| `NOTARY_APPLE_ID` / `NOTARY_TEAM_ID` / `NOTARY_PASSWORD` | `APPLE_ID` / `APPLE_TEAM_ID` / `NOTARY_APP_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD` (used with notarytool's flag form instead of a Keychain `NOTARY_PROFILE`) |
| `SPARKLE_BIN` | the downloaded Sparkle `2.9.5` `bin/` |
| `SPARKLE_ED_KEY_FILE` | temp file holding `SPARKLE_ED_PRIVATE_KEY` |

Locally you instead set `NOTARY_PROFILE` and let `generate_appcast` read the key
from your Keychain — the script supports both paths.

---

## Homebrew tap update

Before bumping the tap, the tagged workflow publishes the GitHub release. If the
release already exists from a failed prior attempt, the workflow edits the title
and notes from the CHANGELOG section and re-uploads the DMG, appcast, and SHA256
assets with `--clobber` so the tap update can be retried by rerunning the job.
The tap bump then checks the newest semantic-versioned, non-prerelease GitHub
release and skips the cask write if this tag is stale, preventing an older rerun
from downgrading Homebrew installs after a newer release has shipped.

On a tagged run the workflow clones `michaeltookes/homebrew-tap`, copies this
repo's `Distribution/sentwise.rb` template over `Casks/sentwise.rb`, stamps the
new `version` and DMG `sha256`, and commits in the tap's house style:
`sentwise: X.Y.Z`.

> The tap's `depends_on` line only updates the next time this workflow runs on a
> tag. Keep the comparison string form (`">= :sonoma"`) so the cask tracks the
> app's Sonoma-or-newer deployment target.

---

## Testing the workflow without a release

Run a dry run to exercise everything that needs no secrets:

```bash
gh workflow run release.yml -f dry_run=true
gh run watch
```

This archives, lays out the DMG, and runs the launch smoke test on the runner —
proving the plumbing without signing, notarizing, or publishing.

---

## First real release checklist

1. Add all seven secrets above.
2. Bump `MARKETING_VERSION` and `CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION`, add the CHANGELOG
   `## [X.Y.Z]` section, and merge to `main`. The build number must be greater
   than the previous stable release's Sparkle build.
3. Tag and push: `git tag v0.1.2 && git push origin v0.1.2`.
4. Watch the run (`gh run watch`); confirm the GitHub release, the appcast
   asset, and the `sentwise: X.Y.Z` commit in the tap.
5. Verify Sparkle auto-update end to end from an installed older build (the
   item 29 / item 11 carry-over).
